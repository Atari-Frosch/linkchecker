# linkchecker
Simple linkchecker, meant as an exercise, now somehow growing.

It started with an exercise:
https://github.com/chaosdorf/coding101/blob/master/Aufgaben/lvl3.md

In favour of a planned project of mine I changed it a bit and started new challenges.
The linkchecker is still „work in progress“.

The current version was made with python 2.7.3 on Debian GNU/Linux Wheezy.
